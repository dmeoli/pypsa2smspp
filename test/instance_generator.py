"""
Generator of the SMS++ instances translated from the PyPSA test networks.

Each Excel test network is built once and written in both the forms the
conversion supports: the UCBlock one, where the design variables are those of
the UCBlock itself (`capacity_expansion_ucblock=True`), and the
InvestmentBlock one, where an InvestmentBlock wraps it
(`capacity_expansion_ucblock=False`). Both are written from the same network
and are held to the same reference, the objective value PyPSA computes on it,
which is printed in the format of the REF_OBJ entries of the SMS++ batch
files `tests/UCBlock/batches/batch-pypsa` and
`tests/InvestmentBlock/batches/batch-pypsa`.

The demand and the hydro inflow of a test network are drawn from a normal
distribution [see add_demand() and add_hydro_inflow() of NetworkDefinition],
so two builds of the same Excel file give two different networks; the seed of
each case is therefore fixed here, which makes the instances reproducible and
the two forms of a case the same problem.

Usage:
    python instance_generator.py <UCBlock output directory>
                                 <InvestmentBlock output directory>
                                 [case ...]

with no case, every Excel test network is written.
